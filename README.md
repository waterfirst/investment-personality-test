# 투자 성향 테스트 애플리케이션

이 프로젝트는 사용자의 투자 성향을 분석하고 개인화된 투자 전략을 제안하는 인터랙티브 웹 애플리케이션입니다.

## 소개

투자 성향 테스트는 사용자가 10개의 질문에 답하면서 자신의 투자 성향을 알아볼 수 있는 도구입니다. 사용자의 응답을 바탕으로 6가지 투자자 유형 중 하나를 결정하고, 그에 맞는 투자 전략과 포트폴리오 구성을 제안합니다.

### 투자자 유형

- 안정 수호자 (거북이)
- 균형 노련가 (올빼미)
- 가치 발굴가 (여우)
- 배당 소득가 (꿀벌)
- 트렌드 서퍼 (돌고래)
- 미래 선구자 (독수리)

## 설치 및 실행

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
